# Chrun-Modeling
Chrun modeling using famous Algorithams XG Boost and ANN apporch

A churn model is a mathematical representation of how churn impacts your business. Churn calculations are built on existing data â€“ the number of customers who left your service during a given time period. A predictive churn model extrapolates on this data to show future potential churn rates.

XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library. It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems.

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.
